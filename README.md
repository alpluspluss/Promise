# Promise
A lightweight implementation of `Promise`, a programming construct used to represent the status of an asynchronous operation.
This implementation is solely for educational purposes, showcasing how a basic promise system works in Luau.

Promises have three states:

- Pending: The initial state, waiting for resolution or rejection.
- Resolved: Indicates the operation was successful, returning a value.
- Rejected: Indicates the operation failed, returning a reason for failure.
